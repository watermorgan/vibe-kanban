# Development Notes

## Scope
- This run is an audit-focused task (`role-qa-security`), not a new implementation task.
- No new code changes were produced by this run.

## Evidence Reviewed
- `crates/server/src/routes/starbus.rs`
- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/actions-dropdown.tsx`
- `docs/starbus/v2-i1-ops-log.md`

## Conclusion
- Development-side output for this task is "no additional implementation".
- Actionable implementation gaps are documented in `06-audit.md` and should be addressed in follow-up tasks.
